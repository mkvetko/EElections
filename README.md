# EElections

This project is to showcase how Electronic elections can be simple project from all perspectives. 
The only challenge in Electronic Elections is security of datacenters and but code wise it is very simple task and the implementation here will just proof it

# Background
Czech goverement is still somehow scared that Electronic elections will allow manipulations with results which may be only true if system has weak point. Another fear is that votes can be linked to respective persons whcih is also not true. These false proclamations slows down implementations of Electronic elections in Czech election system and causes that modern people leaves their voting rights unused.

# Goal
The implementation is showcase how to build secure, will be fully operational for target market - Czech republic and will be even hosetd in google cloud.
Note that security of google cloud, hosting in general is not matter of the coding in right sense ofthe word as if someone steals disk unecrypted data from data center, hardly you can blame software there, anyway this solution will only tell you if someone voted or not, it will give option to decode back how that person voted.
